# Timbers Army

A reconstruction of the Timbers Army website.

## Thoughts and Feedback

This was a beneficial assignment in understanding SASS better. John and I spent a lot of time researching and probably too much time on the wire framing. We began the process white boarding a layout for the website and then made a wire layout before starting any coding.

We had some issued with formatting the height of the cards in the blog section. We ended up scrapping our original idea and got everything working using flex box.

After the second day, I walked away with a better understanding of mixins, import, SASS file structure, nesting, and the benefits of using variables.

It was good to have something to work on that both of us are excited about. We plan to continue to work on this project for awhile as we gain a better understanding of the tools are available to us.

| Element | Implementation    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| Variables     | We stored each color value that we were using as well as our font.      |
| Nesting | We used nesting in our code to simplify everything. This was beneficial in the long run while searching through our styles to make changes. |
| Mixins | We used one mixin for our column layout. |
| Import/Partials | We used import on every layout section of our project. This eliminated the need to link multiple http requests for styling. |
| Operators | We used math operators when generating the function for our column section. |

Today I am hoping to use extend/inheritance for the second layout. This seems like a beneficial took in keeping code a lot more dry, so I am planning on getting a better understanding of how this works.

I plan on focusing to make the hero image respond accordingly for mobile first. Second, I would like to make the navigation bar disappear into a hamburger menu with the 107ist logo displayed on the opposite side of where the menu is. The rest of the page will sit in a single column.
